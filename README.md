# Screening-Test
The repository consists of the solutions of two ML problem statements for the screening test

## Problem 1: Review Sentiment Analysis

An online fashion retailer wants to develop a machine learning model that can classify
customer reviews into different sentiment categories. The model will take as input a
customer review and output a prediction of the review's sentiment, such as positive,
negative, or neutral. Develop a ML model for aforesaid classification with an example
Dataset.

Description: The dataset used for this analysis is the "Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews" dataset. This dataset contains information about clothing reviews, including the text of the review and the associated rating. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model.

## Problem 2: Medical Readmission

A hospital has a large dataset of patient records, including information on demographics,
medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. The hospital wants to use this data
to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of readmission for patients
after they are discharged from the hospital. Develop a ML solution for the aforesaid
prediction with an example Dataset.
